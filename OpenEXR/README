The OpenEXR distribution is covered by a modified BSD license; see
the file named COPYING (included in this distribution) for details.

The release includes exrdisplay, an image viewer for OpenEXR images.  
It requires FLTK 1.1 or greater and OpenGL.  It should work on OS X
if you have FLTK 1.1 with OpenGL support installed, but we haven't
tested it yet.


About the OpenEXR libraries:

Half is a class that encapsulates our 16-bit floating-point format.

IlmImf is our "EXR" file format for storing 16-bit FP images.

Imath is a math library.  IlmImf only uses a subset of it,
but we're releasing the full library because it's easier for us to 
maintain, and we think it'll be useful to others.

Iex is an exception-handling library.

Documentation on all of these libraries is incomplete.  See the .h files
for API details.  Most of the interfaces are well-documented from
a programmer's perspective.  See the source for the exrdisplay image
viewer for examples on how to use IlmImf and Half.  The doc directory
contains some high-level documentation and history about the OpenEXR
format.

To build OpenEXR on OS X or GNU/Linux systems, do:

./configure
make
make install

Do 'make check' to run confidence tests.  See the INSTALL file for more
details or try "./configure --help".

Other UNIX variants haven't been tested, but should be easy to build.
Let us know if you're having problems porting OpenEXR to a particular
platform.  See below for platform-specific notes.

To build on Windows, you'll probably need Cygwin until we have native
project files for Visual C++.

All include files needed to use the OpenEXR libraries are installed in the 
OpenEXR subdirectory of the install prefix, e.g. /usr/local/include/OpenEXR.


PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES
-----------------------

OS X:

We've only tested OpenEXR with OS X 10.2 (Jaguar).  It may work with
the version of gcc 3.1 distributed with the April 2002 developer tools 
on earlier versions of OS X, but we don't plan on supporting them.  You'll
probably have a tough time getting OpenEXR to work with gcc 2.95.2 on OS X
due to lack of sstream, among other things.

OpenEXR isn't quite working yet on OS X 10.2 due to a bug in Apple's
istream::read implementation.  See README.OSX for details and a (hacky)
workaround.

Shared libraries aren't supported yet on OS X.  You can build them, but
we have't gotten them to link due to undefined symbols; we're probably
doing something wrong in the Makefile system.  The test suite will 
automatically try to link shared libraries if you've built them, so
'make check' will fail.  To run the confidence tests, tell configure
not to build shared libraries ("./configure --enable-shared=no").
